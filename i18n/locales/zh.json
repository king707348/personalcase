        "我是一名熱愛打造流暢使用者介面的前端工程師。",
        "過去三年多的業界經驗，讓我透過維護大型專案和專注於原生 JavaScript 開發，打下了扎實的語言核心基礎。這段經歷讓我深刻體會到良好程式架構的價值，也成為我擁抱現代框架的穩固基石。",
        "然而，真正點燃我熱情的，是在工作之餘，一頭栽進現代前端框架的世界。我特別享受用 Vue 和 Nuxt 來打造專案，從構想到實作成品，這個過程總能帶給我巨大的成就感。對我來說，寫程式就像一場無盡的探險，我不只滿足於前端，也對後端、DevOps 等任何新奇的領域充滿好奇。",
        "這份探索的熱情也延伸到了我的生活。下了班，我喜歡用雙腳去認識世界，無論是穿梭在山林步道、在城市中迎風慢跑，偶爾也享受從零開始，規劃一趟充滿細節的旅遊行程。",
        "歡迎隨時找我聊聊技術、分享你的私房登山路線，或來一場燒腦的棋局！"
